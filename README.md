# Coursera_Capstone
This project is a Applied DS course capstone for traffic accident prediction

The business problem is to reduce severe accidents and save lives. On one hand, severe accidents can be avoided by means of public policy guidelines in the transportation sector, safety regulations both for pedestrians and drivers. Another solution is to use data driven apprroach to predict accidents. Then based on the predictions, make decisions accordingly. In our case, this can be solved by predicting the probability of severe accident based on the data on hand.
Further in the analysis, we should adapt our solutions based on the outcomes we get from such analysis.
